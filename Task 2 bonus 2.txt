If we assume that my household has :
10 Lamps = 10 * 6W = 60W for 10 Hours/day
2 TVs = 2 * 100W = 200W for 5 Hours/day
1 Fridge = 65W for 24 Hours/day
2 ACs = 2 * 1000W = 2000W for 8 Hours/day
2 Fans = 2 * 100W = 200W for 4 Hours/day
1 Laptop = 200W for 5 Hours/day
Then the total Watthour for day is 21 KWh
The total power consumtion for  month is 630 KWh
If the cost per KWh from 351 KWh to 650 KWh is 1.4 EGP
Then the total cost is 882 EGP
We can reduce this poer consumtion be decreasing the usage of:
ACs for only 3 hours each
TVs for only 2 hours each
That would make a HUGE diffrence
Then the total power consumtion would be 310 KWh
If the cost per KWh from 201 KWh to 350 KWh is 1.25 EGP
Then the total cost is 387.5 EGP
That is less the half :)
