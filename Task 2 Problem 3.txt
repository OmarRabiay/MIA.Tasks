List of components:
1. 4 Motors = 4*4A = 16A, 12V, Power = 192W
2. Camera = 0.5A , 12V, Power = 6W
Total power consumption = 198W
The energy required to power this system for 1h = 198Wh
Then we need for 0.5h = 99Wh
Then the battery required must at least be 12V 8.25Ah
As a safty measure we will search for a 12V 9Ah battery
If we search locally in Egypt we would find :
- (Ultra cell) 12V 9Ah Lead Acid battery for 1,150 EGP on Amazon
This is the most cost efficient option but it is heavy and bulky but cyborg's body would handle it with ease.
If we search internationally We would find:
-(Ionic) 12V 9Ah Lithium LiFePO4 battery for 99$
This option is massivly more expensive but it is 70% lighter and has two to four times the service life giving cyborg more mobility and longer lasting time before having to replace it later.
