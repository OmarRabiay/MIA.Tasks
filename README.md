## What I Learned

-   **Basic Idea**: A neural network is like a simplified version of the brain. It has different layers of "neurons" that work together to process information.
-   **How It Works**: Neurons take in data, adjust it with weights and biases, and then pass it through an activation function to get the final output.
-   **Training**: Neural networks learn by practicing on data and making adjustments. They try to get better by reducing mistakes over time.
-   **Gradient Descent**: This is a way to update the networkâ€™s settings to minimize errors. It's like tweaking a recipe until it tastes just right.
-   **Overfitting**: Sometimes, the network gets too good at remembering the training data, which makes it less effective with new data.
-   **Regularization**: Techniques like dropout and data augmentation help prevent overfitting by making the network more general and less likely to memorize specific examples.

-   **Deep Learning**: This is about using neural networks with many layers to learn more complex patterns.
  ## Comparison of Neural Network Implementations

### Ease of Use

- **From Scratch**: Requires writing a lot of code for each step. It can be complex and error-prone.
- **PyTorch**: Provides built-in tools and functions that make building and training models much easier and faster.

### Performance

- **From Scratch**: slower and less efficient.
- **PyTorch**: Optimized for performance and can use GPUs, making it faster and more efficient for training large models.

### Flexibility

- **From Scratch**: Gives you full control over every detail, but requires more effort and manual work.
- **PyTorch**: Offers a good balance of flexibility and ease of use, with many built-in features for customization and experimentation.
