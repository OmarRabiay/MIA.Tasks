## Comparison of Neural Network Implementations

### Ease of Use

- **From Scratch**: Requires writing a lot of code for each step. It can be complex and error-prone.
- **PyTorch**: Provides built-in tools and functions that make building and training models much easier and faster.

### Performance

- **From Scratch**: slower and less efficient.
- **PyTorch**: Optimized for performance and can use GPUs, making it faster and more efficient for training large models.

### Flexibility

- **From Scratch**: Gives you full control over every detail, but requires more effort and manual work.
- **PyTorch**: Offers a good balance of flexibility and ease of use, with many built-in features for customization and experimentation.
